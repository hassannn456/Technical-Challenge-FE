## User Logic and Signup Process

### **Signup Flow**:

1. **Fields in Signup Form**: The signup process involves the following fields:

   - **Email**: Used as a unique identifier for the user.
   - **Password**: User's chosen password (hashed on the backend).
   - **First Name**: User's first name.
   - **Last Name**: User's last name.
   - **Role**: Defines the userâ€™s role (either `customer` or `merchant`).

   The role field helps determine which dashboard the user will have access to after they log in.

### **Login Flow**:

- The login form includes **Email** and **Password** fields.
- Upon successful login, the backend returns a JWT that must be stored for maintaining the user's session.
- The user is redirected to their respective dashboard based on their role (Customer or Merchant).

### **Admin Login (No Signup from Frontend)**:

- **Admin Credentials**:

  - **Email**: `hassanchaudhary@gmail.com`
  - **Password**: `123456`

  The admin login cannot be created from the frontend. The admin account is pre-configured with the credentials provided above and is used to access an administrative dashboard.

  - **Admin Role**: This role is different from `customer` or `merchant` and should be used to access special admin features.
  - **Important**: Admin users do not go through the signup process via the frontend. The admin account is manually created in the backend.

### **Role-Based Access Control**:

- **Customer Dashboard**: Accessible to users with the role `customer`.
- **Merchant Dashboard**: Accessible to users with the role `merchant`, where they can manage stores.

## Pages and Routes

- **`/auth/login`**: The login page where users can log in using their email and password.
- **`/auth/register`**: The registration page for new users to sign up (with fields for email, password, first name, last name, and role).
- **`/dashboard/admin`**: The admin dashboard, which can only be accessed by users with the `admin` role (using pre-configured credentials).
- **`/dashboard/merchant`**: The merchant dashboard, where users with the `merchant` role can manage stores.
- **`/dashboard/customer`**: The customer dashboard, where users with the `customer` role can view their profile and other customer-specific information.
